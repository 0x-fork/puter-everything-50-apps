/**
 * Drop a .vcf anywhere on the app and it imports — the gesture people try
 * before they go looking for the menu item.
 *
 * Two kinds of drop reach an app, and they arrive by completely different
 * routes:
 *
 *   - A file dragged from the *host OS* (Finder, a download, a mail
 *     attachment) lands as an ordinary HTML5 drop, with a File in
 *     `dataTransfer.files`. This is the only kind on the open web.
 *   - A file dragged from the *Puter desktop* fires no DOM drag event at all —
 *     the desktop is dragging its own element, in its own document, and our
 *     window is an iframe underneath it. Puter delivers those to us through
 *     `puter.ui.onItemsOpened` instead, as cloud items to read.
 *
 * Both funnel into one importer, so a dropped card behaves the same wherever
 * it came from. Registering `onItemsOpened` also covers opening a .vcf *with*
 * Contacts from the desktop, which should do exactly the same thing.
 *
 * The module is transport-only: it decides what was dropped and hands over
 * something that reads like a file (`name` + `text()`). The importing itself
 * stays in app.js, shared with the file picker.
