/**
 * Transport for the Contacts API: reads requests off an AppConnection,
 * dispatches them to the method table, and posts replies back.
 *
 * The connection carries two protocols, and a message says which it is in.
 *
 * ── The app-to-app protocol (`$: 'contacts-api'`) ─────────────────────────────
 * One request → one reply, matched by the caller's `id`:
 *   in   { $: 'contacts-api', v: 1, id, method, params }
 *   out  { $: 'contacts-api', v: 1, id, ok: true,  result }
 *        { $: 'contacts-api', v: 1, id, ok: false, error: { code, message, details? } }
 *
 * Two unsolicited notices are also posted (neither carries an `id`):
 *   { $: 'contacts-api', v: 1, type: 'ready',   methods: [...] }  — on start
 *   { $: 'contacts-api', v: 1, type: 'changed' }                  — after the
 *       address book actually changed, so a client can drop a cached snapshot.
 *       Reads never provoke one, however often the store re-reads itself.
 *
 * ── MCP (`jsonrpc: '2.0'`) ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The same address book, spoken in the protocol AI clients already know. See
 * mcp.js. A caller picks a protocol simply by writing in it; there is no mode to
 * negotiate and no second connection to open, which is what lets one app use
 * both — the calendar's autocomplete on the fast path, an agent's tool call on
 * the same wire.
 *
 * Anything in neither dialect is ignored, as it always was.
