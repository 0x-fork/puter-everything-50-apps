/**
 * The user's calendar, borrowed from the Calendar app.
 *
 * This is the other direction of the door Contacts already opens: the Calendar
 * reads this address book to suggest guests (see src/api/), and here we read and
 * write its events over the same kind of AppConnection
 * (https://docs.puter.com/Objects/AppConnection/). We launch Calendar in service
 * mode — no UI, `background: true` so the desktop never puts a window on screen
 * — and talk to the connection `puter.ui.launchApp` hands back. Calendar only
 * answers apps on its own allowlist, so this works because the desktop tells it,
 * from the calling process rather than from anything we could claim, that the
 * caller is `contacts`.
 *
 * ── What this is deliberately not ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * There is no cached copy of the calendar here, and no background syncing. The
 * Calendar's client caches our address book because it matches it against every
 * keystroke in the guest field; nothing in Contacts asks the calendar anything
 * per keystroke. Our two questions — "what's coming up with this person?" and
 * "is this birthday already on the calendar?" — are asked at most once per
 * contact the user opens, are answered from the live calendar, and are worth
 * nothing when stale. A short-lived connection with an idle close is the whole
 * mechanism.
 *
 * Everything degrades to "no calendar": on the open web there is no desktop to
 * launch anything into (puter.env !== 'app'), Calendar may not be installed, and
 * the user may not have it. Reads answer with null and the UI shows nothing;
 * writes reject with a message the caller can put in a toast. After a failure we
 * back off, doubling, so a missing Calendar costs one launch attempt rather than
 * one per contact — but only for failures that mean *unreachable*. A refusal
 * the Calendar sent us (`CalendarApiError`) proves the opposite and clears the
 * backoff, so one "no event with that id" cannot take the calendar away from
 * every contact card for a minute.
